# BMI Calcilator
For those who would like to check their BMI, as I am one of them. I made the BMI calcuator and also to practice Python and Jupyter Notebook. There are 2 options for the BMI count - pounds and kilograms.  

I've found how to do the first part of the project and decided to make the second part by myself with kilograms. I also added new warnings in case entered values would exceed the possible range.
While researching the highest BMI in history to define the range, I've read about the heaviest recorded human - Jon Brower Minnoch. He weighed 12 times his 50 kilograms wife! His BMI was 186 kg/m2. As it is possible that there will be another heaviest person in history, I left some room for a new record. The limit was set at 200.
